I love @106388 , classics like @153918\n","11: Yes! @106388 was one of my favorites too!\n","8: But one of my favorites is @204341\n","8: And if I'm going to watch horror, instead of the gore like @115463 I really prefer movies like @97819\n","11: Ok that's an older one right?\n","11: I also love lawyer movies like @145338\n","8: Yea, the year wasn't added on the drop down list it was from 1960 I think\n","11: Ok gotcha.\n","8: Yes, @145338 was so good. Another good one is @99324 . I don't think she was a lawyer though, maybe a paralegal. But it was one of my favorites for a while\n","8: Hope I made some good suggestions!
